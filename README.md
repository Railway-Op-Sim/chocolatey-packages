# ROS Chocolatey Package
Allows the installation of RailOS via the [Chocolatey Package Manager](https://community.chocolatey.org/) for Windows. The setup will install RailOS into `C:\Program Files\RailwayOperationSimulator`. This is currently under review but will allow users to run:

## Install
```pwsh
choco install railwayopsim
```

## Uninstall
```pwsh
choco uninstall railwayopsim
```

## Upgrade
```pwsh
choco upgrade railwayopsim
```
